                    I am Cor Pruijs, and this website is mine.
                </h2>

                <p>
                    I like programming a lot, and a website is one of the
                    first things i ever made. <br/>
                    That website is this one, although it has evolved to a much better looking site than it originally was.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Nowadays, i'm more into game development rather than web development
                    (although i still like some occasional web development),
                    and i use this website to showcase some of my projects. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Most of my projects are open source, and they often include lots of comments.
                    so feel free to take a look at them <a href="http://github.com/CorPruijs"> on Github.</a> <br/>
